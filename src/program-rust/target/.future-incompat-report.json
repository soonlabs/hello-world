{"version":0,"next_id":2,"reports":[{"id":1,"suggestion_message":"\nTo solve this problem, you can try the following approaches:\n\n\n- Some affected dependencies have newer versions available.\nYou may want to consider updating them to a newer version to see if the issue has been fixed.\n\nwasm-bindgen v0.2.79 has the following newer versions available: 0.2.80, 0.2.81, 0.2.82, 0.2.83, 0.2.84, 0.2.85, 0.2.86, 0.2.87, 0.2.89, 0.2.90, 0.2.91, 0.2.92, 0.2.93\n\n\n- If the issue is not solved by updating the dependencies, a fix has to be\nimplemented by those dependencies. You can help with that by notifying the\nmaintainers of this problem (e.g. by creating a bug report) or by proposing a\nfix to the maintainers (e.g. by creating a pull request):\n\n  - wasm-bindgen@0.2.79\n  - Repository: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen\n  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package wasm-bindgen@0.2.79`\n\n- If waiting for an upstream fix is not an option, you can use the `[patch]`\nsection in `Cargo.toml` to use your own version of the dependency.
